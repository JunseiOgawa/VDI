## What to Do When a Task is Completed

- No specific linting, formatting, or testing commands are defined.
- For TypeScript: Rely on tsconfig.json strict settings.
- For Rust: Standard Cargo checks.
- Build and verify with `tauri build` if needed, but avoid running builds as per instructions.
- Update README or docs if necessary.
